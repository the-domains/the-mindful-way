This workshop is open to anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of how mindfulness in relationship can be drawn on as a profound basis for enquiry within personal relationships, and how it can be applied in counselling, psychotherapy and other helping roles within the workplace or community life.

**What is Core Process Psychotherapy?**  
This 2-day workshop offers a 'taste' of Core Process Psychotherapy, which is rooted in a Buddhist understanding of mind and embodied sensitivity integrated with the relational understanding of Western psychotherapy. The workshop will include talks, experiential exercises and enquiry. No affiliation to Buddhism is required.
