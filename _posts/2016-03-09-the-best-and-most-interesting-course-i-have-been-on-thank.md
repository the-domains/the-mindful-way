### Testimonials

What course participants said...

"I have loved this course - to my great surprise. It has been a revelation. My sleep is returning and I feel much calmer. Long may I continue to do this!"

"I really really enjoyed the course. Patricia's wisdom, kindness and patience made her an excellent tutor. Thank you - this is such a valuable life skill. I truly believe this is the start of something very important for me and my family."

"The pacing was perfect. The programme excellent and insightful."

"I found the entire course very enjoyable and feel I have gained a very valuable skill to help myself in very busy and stressful times."

"I really found the whole course so useful and even in just 8 weeks I can notice a difference in myself, how I relate to stress, to life situations and to myself. Thank you!"

"I have very much enjoyed the course - the teaching was excellent as was the written information given. The size of the group was just right in terms of having enough people to share their experiences, but still small enough to feel impersonal."

"I took the dog for a walk not knowing where I was going...I just walked. I had never just wandered out without a plan before...with my anxiety I always needed to know where I was going. It was a totally new experience and it was fine...I felt happy and elated...I realised it was perfectly OK to be without knowing.

"I caught myself rushing and getting anxious about how long the water was taking to run in the bath -- then I remembered I could do it differently. I stopped and watched the running water ...I watched it flowing from the tap. I'd never seen it like that before. It was such a beautiful experience. Then I thought -- what else have I been missing?"
