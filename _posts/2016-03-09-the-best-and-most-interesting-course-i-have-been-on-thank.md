  “I took the dog for a walk not knowing where I was going…I just walked. I had
  never just wandered out without a plan before…with my anxiety I always needed
  to know where I was going. It was a totally new experience and it was fine…I
  felt happy and elated…I realised it was perfectly OK to be without knowing.
