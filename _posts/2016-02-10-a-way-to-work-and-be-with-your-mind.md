# a way to work with your mind

Mindfulness is a mind training...  
you learn to steer your focus on to specific objects such as the breath, body and sound. And whenever the mind moves away from your chosen object - you simply return to your point of focus. Repeating this simple practice continuously and regularly sharpens focus and builds capacity to sustain and to 'be with' arising process. That is the essence of Mindfulness. A simple practice which delivers subtle yet profound results. 

So is there a catch? Well yes...the catch is ...it may be a simple practice but that doesn't mean it's easy. The benefits only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best...and for a minimum of 30 minutes. You can boost your daily Mindful work-in by bringing Mindful awareness to every day activities such as washing the dishes, brushing your teeth but the core of your practice is what I call the 'work in'.   
The Mindful 'work in' is 'time out' of your continuous 'doing' but it is in fact 'time in'. Finding a quiet space to sit, lie or stand ...gathering and turning attention to the space inside you ...to your inner processes. Simply watching, noticing, acknowledging... being receptive to the ebb and flow of your inner world. That vibrant life inside you ... the coming and going of thoughts, feelings, sensations, images and impulses. And your intention? To do nothing. Not trying to be or to go or to get or to do anything at all. Simply to be with, to notice the flow. Not interfering with the flow. Just noticing.
