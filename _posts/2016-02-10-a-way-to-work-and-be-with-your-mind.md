# working with your mind

Mindfulness is a mind training...

Training the mind involves regular practice - working with intention and attention. 

It's like having agreed to be the 'driver' of your mind (intention) you  step into the driver seat and with your hands on the wheel you steer and direct the focus of your attention.  

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse, goes where it will. With you in the driver seat and a gentle careful touch, whenever attention wanders simply return to your point of focus. 

Repeating this simple practice continuously and regularly build the mindful 'muscle' and the capacity to sustain and to 'be with' arising process. That is the essence of Mindfulness. A simple practice which delivers subtle yet profound results. 

So is there a catch? Well yes...there is. The technique is simple. But that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits of Mindfulness practice only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best...and for a minimum of 30 minutes. Yes it's true you can boost your practice bringing Mindful awareness into every day activities such as washing the dishes and brushing your teeth, but the core of your practice is the Mindful 'work in'.

The Mindful 'work in' is time out of your continuous day to day doings and 'time in' for your daily Mindful practice. 

Finding a quiet space to be...and retreating from the world outside you, turn your attention inwards to the world inside you ...to your inner processes. 

Watch, notice and acknowledge... and with a spacious open quality of looking, simply be receptive to the ebb and flow of your inner world. 

Marvel at that vibrant inner life  ... to the coming and going of thoughts, feelings, sensations, images and impulses. And your intention? 

To do absolutely nothing at all. Not trying to be or to go or to get or to do anything. Simply be with whatever comes into your awareness, look and notice the stream and flow of inner processes as they appear and disappear. 

Don't interfere - do nothing.  Do nothing. Simply see and be.
