Mindfulness is a mind training which involves working with awareness, attention and intention. 

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse takes flight, it goes where it will. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7daca733a68231fdccd5601d607e6ab58994ce8a.jpg)

With patience and practice, mindfulness cultivates a way of working in harmony with the wandering mind.

Mindfulness practice opens a window to the nuance of each moment, to the detail of your life.

It reveals the unseen motives that compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences.

Mindfulness develops presence and awareness of the here and now. 

With a growing sense of spaciousness and conscious awareness ...we respond to life events rather than react. 

Mindfulness is a simple practice ...but that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best. 

Mindfulness practice is not about trying, making an effort to do ... or to be a particular way. 

The practice is simply to notice and acknowledge what is. .

To notice thoughts, feelings and sensations as they appear and disappear...and do nothing 

Simply see and allow each moment to be what it is.
