Mindfulness is a mind training which involves  awareness, attention and intention. 

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse takes flight, it goes where it will. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7daca733a68231fdccd5601d607e6ab58994ce8a.jpg)

With patience and practice, mindfulness cultivates a way of accompanying and being in harmony with the wandering mind. We gently guide the wandering mind with a lightness of touch and return our attention to the chosen point of focus. 

Mindfulness practice opens us to the nuance of each moment, to the detail of  life. It reveals the unseen motives that compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences. 

Mindfulness cultivates a ground of presence and receptivity to our direct experience whatever happens.

With a growing sense of spaciousness and conscious awareness ...we respond to life events rather than react. 

Mindfulness is a simple practice ...but that doesn't mean it's easy. The benefits only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best. 

Mindfulness practice is not about trying, making an effort to do ... or to be a particular way or achieve a particular state. 

The practice is simply to notice and acknowledge what is.

To notice thoughts, feelings and sensations as they appear and disappear...and do nothing 

Simply see and allow each moment to be what it is.
