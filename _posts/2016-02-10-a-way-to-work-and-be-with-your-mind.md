Mindfulness is a mind training which involves working with awareness, attention and intention. 

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse, goes where it will. 

The Mindful Way means that you take the reins ... you become the guide and director of your mind.

With a lightness of touch, patience and practice, the mindful way works in harmony with the wandering mind.

Engaging with 'time' in a new way, Mindfulness practice opens a window to the subtle ...the nuance of each moment, to the detail of your life, to this 'being' called I.

The unseen motives that fuel our existence and actions compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences.

Mindfulness is the antidote to ignorance ...because it cultivates awareness. It tunes up our capacity for awareness of the here and now. 

It literally lays down new pathways, creating more possibility and choice. With a growing sense of spaciousness and conscious awareness ...we respond to life events rather than react. 

Mindfulness is a simple practice which delivers subtle yet profound results. So is there a catch? 

Well yes...there is. The approach is simple ...but that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits of Mindfulness practice will only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best. 

Mindfulness practice may also extend to daily activities such as washing the dishes or walking the dog, but the core of your practice is the Mindful 'work in'.

The Mindful 'work in' is time out of  'doing' and 'time in' for just 'being'. This is your daily  sit. 

One of the three core practices in Mindfulness, the daily sit is a retreat from your outer environment to the world inside you ...to simply notice what is here now. 

Noticing and acknowledging all that is .. . is the essence of mind training. Witnessing with non-judgemental receptivity  the ebb and flow and of your inner life ...all of it ...including the welcome and not so welcome.

And your intention? 

Your intention is to do absolutely nothing at all. Neither to be or to go or to get or to do anything. 

But simply to be with whatever comes into your awareness, to look and notice the stream and flow of events as they appear and disappear. 

Don't interfere - and don't try to change it! Do nothing. 

Simply see and allow everything to be what it is.
