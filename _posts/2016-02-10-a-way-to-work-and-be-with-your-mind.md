Mindfulness is a mind training which involves working with awareness, attention and intention. 

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse, goes where it will. 

The Mindful Way means that you take the reins ... you become the guide and director of your mind.

With a lightness of touch, patience and practice, the mindful way works in harmony with the wandering mind.

Engaging with 'time' in a new way, Mindfulness practice opens a window to the subtle ...the nuance of each moment, to the detail of your life.

The unseen motives that fuel our existence and actions compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences.

Mindfulness tunes up our capacity for awareness of the here and now. 

It literally lays down new pathways, creating more possibility and choice. 

With a growing sense of spaciousness and conscious awareness ...we respond to life events rather than react. 

Mindfulness is a simple practice ...but that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits of Mindfulness practice only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best. 

Daily Mindfulness practice is a retreat from your outer environment to the world inside you ...to simply notice what is here and now.

Noticing and acknowledging with non-judgemental receptivity  the ebb and flow and of your inner life ...all of it ...including the welcome and not so welcome.

Mindfulness practice is not about trying, making an effort to do or to be a particular way. 

We cannot strive to be mindful.  We simply notice and acknowledge what is. .  
We look and see the stream and flow of events as they appear and disappear...and we do nothing ...nothing at all.

We don't interfere ...we don't try to change anything. We do nothing.  

Simply see and allow everything to be what it is.
