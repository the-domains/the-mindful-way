**about mindfulness**

Mindfulness is a mind training...more specifically it is attentional training

The Mindful Way involves regular practice and working with awareness, attention and intention. 

It's like having agreed to be the 'driver' of your mind (intention) you  step into the driver seat take the wheel and steer and direct your attention.

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse, goes where it will. 

With you in the driver seat and a gentle careful touch, whenever you notice attention has wandered, you simply return to the point of focus. 

Repeating this simple practice continuously and regularly builds the mindful 'muscle'.

It builds the capacity to sustain and to 'be with' thoughts, feelings, and emotions and all than arises within. 

That is the essence of Mindfulness. A simple practice which delivers subtle yet profound results. 

So is there a catch? Well yes...there is. The approach is simple. But that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits of Mindfulness practice only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best...and for a minimum of 30 minutes. 

Practice also includes being mindfulness to daily activities such as washing the dishes and brushing your teeth, but the core of your practice is the Mindful 'work in'.

The Mindful 'work in' is time out of your continuous day to day doings and 'time in' for your daily Mindful sit. 

Finding a quiet space to be...and retreating from your outer environment, turn your attention inwards to the world inside you ...and notice what is here. 

Look with curiosity, notice and acknowledge... and with a spacious open attitude, be receptive to the ebb and flow of your inner world. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e7726e4c-2ea8-4b19-8b5f-5494161d6dd9.jpg)

Marvel at that vibrant inner life  ... to the coming and going of thoughts, feelings, sensations, images and impulses. 

And your intention? 

Your intention is to do absolutely nothing at all. Neither to be or to go or to get or to do anything. 

Simply be with whatever comes into your awareness, look and notice the stream and flow of inner processes as they appear and disappear. 

Don't interfere - do nothing.  

Do nothing ... simply see and be.
