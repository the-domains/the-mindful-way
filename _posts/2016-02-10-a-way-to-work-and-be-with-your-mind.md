### What is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness is a mind training which involves awareness, attention and intention.  
With patience and practice, mindfulness cultivates a way of accompanying and being in harmony with the wandering mind. We gently guide the wandering mind with a lightness of touch and return our attention to the chosen point of focus.

With a growing sense of spaciousness and conscious awareness ...we respond to life events rather than react.

Mindfulness is a simple practice ...but that doesn't mean it's easy. The benefits only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best.

Mindfulness practice is not about trying, making an effort to do ... or to be a particular way or achieve a particular state.

The practice is simply to notice and acknowledge what is.

To notice thoughts, feelings and sensations as they appear and disappear...and do nothing

Simply see and allow each moment to be what it is.

Mindfulness practice opens us to the nuance of each moment, to the detail of life. It reveals the unseen motives that compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences.

Mindfulness cultivates a ground of presence and receptivity to our direct experience whatever happens.
