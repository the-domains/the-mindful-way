Mindfulness is a mind training which involves working with awareness, attention and intention. 

The untrained mind, like an untrained horse, goes where it will. 

The Mindful Way means that you take the reins ... you become the guide and director of your mind.

With a lightness of touch, patience and practice, the mindful way works in harmony with the wandering mind.

Engaging with 'time' in a new way, Mindfulness practice opens a window to the subtle ...the nuance of each moment, to the detail of your life, to this 'being' called I.

Whereas the  unseen motives that fuel our existence and actions compel us in unintended directions, with unintended consequences.

Mindfulness cultivates awareness. An awareness attuned to the here and now with a flexible lens on life. It is a simple practice which delivers subtle yet profound results. 

So is there a catch? Well yes...there is. The approach is simple. But that doesn't mean it's easy. 

The benefits of Mindfulness practice only come with regular and consistent practice. Every day is best. 

Mindfulness practice can also be extended to daily activities such as washing the dishes or walking the dog, but the core of your practice is the Mindful 'work in'.

The Mindful 'work in' is time out of your continuous day to day doings and 'time in' for your daily Mindful sit. 

One of the three core practices in Mindfulness, the daily sit is a retreat from your outer environment to the world inside you ...to simply notice what is here and how you are. 

And to acknowledge all that is .. . with a spacious open attitude, simply to be receptive to the ebb and flow of your inner world. 

And marvel at that vibrant inner life  ... to the coming and going of thoughts, feelings, sensations, images and impulses ...the welcome and not so welcome.

And your intention? 

Your intention is to do absolutely nothing at all. Neither to be or to go or to get or to do anything. 

Your intention is always to be with whatever comes into your awareness, to look and notice the stream and flow of inner processes as they appear and disappear. 

Don't interfere - and don't try to change it! Do nothing. 

Simply see and allow everything to be what it is.
