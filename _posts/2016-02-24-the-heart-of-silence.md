## A conference and enquiry, exploring the place of Silence in Psychotherapy, Society and our World.

Despite the weight of increasing stress, depression and fear on a global scale, can the presence of Silence break open our isolation and sense of separateness and offer us a deeper connection to meaning, to ourselves, each other and to the world at large?  

In Silence we can connect with the heart and during this Conference there will be the opportunity to experience and embody Silence together.     
Our speakers and plenaries will focus attention on two central questions:  
What is the nature and role of Silence in relationship?  
How can Silence unify us, in the midst of life today?
