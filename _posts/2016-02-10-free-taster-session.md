_The Group Effect - t_he group effect is an established fact. You may be struggling to maintain a regular practice on your own and Mindfulness practise can feel easier and enhanced within the collective intention of a group. This is a chance to revive and deepen your practice and to reconnect with other local Mindfulers.

Please let me know as soon as possible and by **Monday 26th of June** at the latest, if you wish to attend email: mail@mindfulness-borders.net
