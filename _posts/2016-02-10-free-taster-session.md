The best and most interesting course I have been on. Thank you!"

"I have loved this course -- to my great surprise. It has been a revelation - my sleep is returning and I feel much calmer. Long may I continue to do this!"

I have done a mindfulness course before, but this course really consolidated and clarified the practice and theory for me. Just fab!

"I really found the whole course so useful, and even in 8 weeks I can notice a difference in myself, how I relate to others, to life situations and to myself. Thank you!"
