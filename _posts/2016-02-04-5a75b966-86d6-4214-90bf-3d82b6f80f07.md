****...a way to be with whatever life brings ****...a practical way to relate to self, others and life events ****

"I took the
dog for a walk not knowing where I was going...I just walked. I had never just
wandered out without a plan before...with my anxiety I always needed to know
where I was going. It was a totally new experience and it was fine...I felt happy
and elated...I realised it was perfectly OK to be without knowing."     _Mindfulness Course Participant_
