**The 8-week MBSR**  
was developed by an American doctor, John Kabat Zin, as a means of reducing stress in his patients. He carried out the first clinical trials for Mindfulness and found that his patients recovered more quickly.

The MBSR is now delivered in hospitals, health and social care services, organisational settings, schools, criminal justice services and even in Parliament!

This 8-week course gives a thorough grounding in the practice and principles of Mindfulness. The course is mainly experiential with the focus on the three core practices.

Home practice is a key aspect of the course and this is encouraged from the outset of the course. All practices are led by a trained facilitator.

The course includes eight weekly sessions on Thursday evenings and a day of practice in a rural setting (usually between weeks 6 & 7). The date for the day of practice is agreed in consultation with the group on week 1\.

A handbook (PDF) accompanies the course with the key learning points, theory, practice instruction and home practice for each week. Each participant is also provided with a link to a range of audio files of guided practices.

Cost: Â£175 (payment may be made instalments and there are one or two concessions available - please ask)

The Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a secular course for beginners. No previous experience of Mindfulness is required.
