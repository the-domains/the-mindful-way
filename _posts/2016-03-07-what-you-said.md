"The best and most interesting course I have been on. Thank you!"

"I have loved this course -- to my great surprise. It has been
a revelation - my sleep is returning and I feel much calmer. Long may I continue
to do this!"

I have done a mindfulness course before, but this course
really consolidated and clarified the practice and theory for me. Just fab!

"I really, really enjoyed this course. Patricia's wisdom, kindness and patience makes her an excellent tutor. Thank you. This is such a valuable life skill. I truly believe this is the start of something very important for me and my family."

"I really found the whole course so useful, and even in 8
weeks I can notice a difference in myself, how I relate to others, to life
situations and to myself. Thank you!"
