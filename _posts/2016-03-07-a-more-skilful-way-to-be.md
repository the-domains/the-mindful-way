"I caught
myself rushing and getting anxious about how long the water was taking to run
in the bath -- then I remembered I could do it differently. I stopped and
watched the running water; I watched it flowing from the tap. I'd never seen it
like that before. It was such a beautiful experience. Then a thought came to me
-- what else have I been missing?"
