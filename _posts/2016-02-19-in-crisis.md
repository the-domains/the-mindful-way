Another view may help you see things differently. You don't have to be on your own with this. It's a fact that however bad you are feeling now, this will change in time.

Here is a simple practice that may help ease your pain...

### one breath at a time...

breathe in a longer than usual breath

breathe out a longer than usual breath

can you hear and feel the energy of this breath

what do you notice as your body breathes?

is there sound...sensation...what do you see and sense?

is it possible simply to follow the ebb and flow of this breath

noticing, listening and sensing the sounds

what happens as your whole body breathes

can you track this one breath breathing in...through the whole body...

can you track this one breath breathing out...through the whole body

can you travel with this one breath ...surfing its rise and fall

can you hear and feel the energy of the whole body breathing

now this onr breath flows in and through the whole body...

now this onr breath flows out and through the whole body

breathing in...you feel nourishment

breathing out...you feel release

know the whole body is breathing in

know the whole body is breathing out

can you feel your feet...and your hands

what sounds and sensations are here

following sounds and energy moving

take comfort in this in-breath and this out-breath

sensing the energy and flow of breath

this one breath and that one breath

allowing all breathing ...be as it is
