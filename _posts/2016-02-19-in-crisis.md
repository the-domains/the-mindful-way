## one breath at a time...

breathe in a longer than usual breath

breathe out a longer than usual breath

can you hear and feel the energy of this breath

can you hear the sounds and feel the sensations of your whole body breathing

what do you notice as your body breathes?

is there sound...sensation...what do you see and sense?

is it possible simply to follow the ebb and flow of this breath

noticing, listening and sensing the sounds 

noticing, listening and sensing the feelings 

what happens as your whole body breathes

can you track this one breath breathing in...through the whole body...

can you track this one breath breathing out...through the whole  body

can you travel with this one breath ...surfing its rise and fall

being with it ... on it ... following and allowing as it flows 

can you hear and feel the energy of this whole body breathing

now this breath flowing in and through the whole body...

now this breath flowing out and through the whole body

breathing in...your are nourished ...feeling nourishment

breathing out...you are letting go ...feeling letting go

breathing aliveness  and energy

breathing renewal and letting go 

know the whole body is breathing in

know the whole body is breathing out

can you feel your feet...and your hands

what sounds and sensations are here 

in your feet...and in your hands

following the  sounds and the energy of the feelings

take refuge in flowing in breath out breath 

following the flow ...

listening to the flow

feel the energy and sensations of your body breathing

as you are nourished ...as you are letting go ...

being with this one breath

letting go with this one breath

letting all of it be as it is

it is what it is ...for now.
