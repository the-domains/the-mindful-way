Here is a simple practice ...it may help ease your pain****

## one breath at a time...

breathe in a longer than usual breath

breathe out a longer than usual breath

can you hear and feel the energy of breath as it moves

can you hear the sounds and feel the sensations of your whole body breathing

what do you notice as your body breathes

is there sound...sensation...movement...

follow the ebb and flow of your breath

noticing, listening and sensing the sounds 

noticing, listening and sensing the feelings 

what happens as your whole body breathes

breathing in...through the whole body...

breathing out...through the whole  body

allowing the energy of your breath to flow through the whole body

can you hear, can you feel the energy of the whole body breathing

breathing in and through the whole body...

breathing out and through the whole body

breathing in...your are nourished ...feeling nourishment

breathing out...you are letting go ...feeling letting go

following the ebb and flow of the breath 

allowing its energy to radiate through the whole body...

your whole body is breathing in

your whole body is breathing out

can you feel your feet...can you feel your hands

what sounds and sensations are here 

in your feet...and in your hands

allowing the energy of the sounds and the energy of the feelings

flowing in breath and through breath and out breath 

following flow ...breathing body ...whole body

listen to the energy and sounds of your body breathing 

feel the energy and sensations of your body breathing

breathing in...your are nourished ...feeling nourishment

breathing out...you are letting go ...feeling letting go

breathing body ...breathing in ... breathing body ...breathing out

whole body breathing in... whole body breathing out

letting all being be with breathing

letting all feeling be with breathing

letting all of it be

for now.
