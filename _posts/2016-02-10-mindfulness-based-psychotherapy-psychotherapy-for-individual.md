Core Process Psychotherapy is one of the original Mindfulness-based psychotherapeutic approaches.

It supports the client to bring awareness to the shadow aspects of self within a safe, supportive environment.

And acknowledges our inherent capacity for healing and health. and invites a depth awareness and bigger picture view of our problems.

The Core Process Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment awaiting recognition.

Through mindful and heartful inquiry, this non-invasive approach enables insight and awareness at the root of current problems .

Step by step the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and underlying motives directing our thoughts, emotions and feelings become known.

Difficulties are not necessarily seen as negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation, integration and clarity.

In fact, these painful aspects of our experience conceal what Jung called the 'gold' ...the gold being none other than our yet-to-be-realised potential.

Denying, avoiding, and resisting what we find difficult means parts of us are split off. Banished to the far corners of our being these suppressed aspects are known as 'the shadow' because the light of our attention is dis-allowed here.

And once these unlived parts of ourselves are seen, reclaimed and integrated, we are able to appreciate a fuller, more embodied and whole sense of self.
