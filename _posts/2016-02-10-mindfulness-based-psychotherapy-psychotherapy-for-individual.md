# mindfulness-based psychotherapy

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy acknowledges our inherent capacity for healing and health. It aims to support this natural ability to heal.

Centred on mindful inquiry the Mindfulness-based Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment awaiting recognition.

Through mindful and heartful inquiry, this gentle, non-invasive approach supports you to find your own answers to current problems .

Step by step the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and underlying motives directing your thoughts, emotions and feelings are revealed.

Difficulties are not seen as  negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation, embodiment and areas for growth.

In fact, these painful edges of our experience conceal what Jung called the 'gold' - the gold is our yet-to-be-realised potential. 

Denying, avoiding, and resisting what we find difficult means these parts of our self  are banished to the far corners of our being. 

These suppressed aspects of our being are known as 'the shadow' regions of self because the light of our attention never shines here. 

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy brings light to these shadow aspects of self.

Once these unlived aspects are seen, acknowledged and integrated, we can appreciate a fuller more embodied and whole sense of self.

Patricia Price is a Mindfulness-based psychotherapist, trained at the Karuna Institute.
