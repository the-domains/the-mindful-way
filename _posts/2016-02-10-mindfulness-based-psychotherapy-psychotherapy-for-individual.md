# mindfulness-based psychotherapy

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy acknowledges our inherent capacity for healing and health. It aims to support this natural ability to heal.

Centred on mindful inquiry the Mindfulness-based Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment awaiting recognition.

Through mindful and heartful inquiry, this gentle, non-invasive approach supports you to find your own answers to current problems .

Step by step the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and underlying motives directing your thoughts, emotions and feelings are revealed.

Difficulties are not seen as  negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation,  embodiment and as areas for growth.

In fact, these painful edges of our experience conceal 'gold' - this gold is our yet to be realised potential. 

Denying, avoiding, and resisting what we find difficult banishes parts of our self  to the far corners of our being. 

These banished parts are known as the shadow regions of being because we never shine the light of attention there. 

These are the unlived parts of our being that seek recognition and complete expression.

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy brings light to these shadow aspects of self. Once seen for what they are, and integrated with our experience, we can appreciate a fuller more embodied and whole sense of self.
