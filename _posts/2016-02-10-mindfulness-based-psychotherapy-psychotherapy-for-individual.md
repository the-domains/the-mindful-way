# Mindfulness-based psychotherapy  
psychotherapy for individuals - couples - groups

Mindfulness-based psychotherapy acknowledges your inherent capacity for healing and health. It aims to support this natural ability to heal.

Centred on mindful inquiry the Mindfulness-based Psychotherapist brings attention in a particular way to what is here in the present moment awaiting recognition.

Working this way offers a gentle, non-invasive approach in which you are supported to find your own answers to current problems through mindful and heartful inquiry.

This mindful approach helps to reveal the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and underlying motives directing your thoughts, emotions and feelings.

Difficulties are not seen as  negative, unwanted or insurmountable - instead these edges of resistance are welcomed as opportunities for realisation,  embodiment and as areas for growth.

Difficult and painful edges conceal 'gold' - your yet to be realised potential. Banished to the shadow of your self, these are the unlived parts of you that seek recognition and complete expression.
